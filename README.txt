Multipe-tau correlation is computed on a logarithmic scale (less
data points are computed) and is thus much faster than conventional
correlation on a linear scale such as `numpy.correlate`.

The code is fully documented. An online documentation is available
at http://paulmueller.github.io/multipletau/.
